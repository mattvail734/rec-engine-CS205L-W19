1:  Read Suprise model documentation, especially formulas to understand how everything is calculated
1b: Read https://github.com/polymathnexus5/rec-engine-CS205L-W19/blob/master/references/3208-probabilistic-matrix-factorization.pdf
2:  Reread course notes and understand matrix factorization --> optimization
3:  Figure out which method(s) to implement
4:  Decide what "performance" will mean (metrics)
5:  Figure out how to measure time required and memory required
6:  Make custom_rec_algo work (Surprise extension) (not sure if this is necessary or not)
7:  Modify custom_matrix_factorization with new factorization methods for better performance
8:  Compare performance to Surprise
9:  Write report
